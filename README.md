# PointCross
Higher order component on React to detect position in browser 

Point Cross is a Wrapper component to execute a callback when the page is scrolled
basing on position of the wrapped children when they are,

1. Before Point
2. In Point
3. After Point

PointCross intuitively decides when the scroll happens on window or even in a scrollable container.
And it also accepts additional offset,
ex: I want the callback to be executed when the component is Xpx before from viewport.
